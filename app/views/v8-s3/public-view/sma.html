              Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)</h1>


              <p class="govuk-body">
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and a progressive loss of movement. There is no cure but therapy and support are available to help manage the condition.

          UK NSC's screening recommendation

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Following a review of the evidence against strict criteria, the UK NSC does not currently recommend introducing a national screening programme for carrier or new-born screening for spinal muscular atrophy.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Key findings supporting the UK NSC recommendation from 2018:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li>there was very limited evidence about how acceptable a screening programme would be</li>
         <li>there was no evidence on how to support individuals who need to make difficult decisions following carrier screening</li>
         <li>there was a lack of information on the reliability of screening tests for SMA</li>
         <li>no effective treatments for SMA were identified in an unsymptomatic population, currently only palliative support can be offered - however, the review identified evidence on a new treatment for SMA, called nusinersen, that can improve symptoms in children with SMA</li>
         <li>this evidence review did not find information on the effectiveness of nusinersen in children without symptoms, and there is no evidence on the long term effects of this drug</li>
